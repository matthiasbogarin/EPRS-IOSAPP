# EPRS-IOSAPP

By Matthias Bogarin, Esau Cuellar, Daniel Vilajeti and Josh Persuad

EPRS was created to automate event creation by using snapping an image of the flyer or syllabus. The app using built in apple machine learning API and image processing to capture the image, prepare it to be inputted to the machine learning model. Which then would spit out the outputs we wanted to display to the user to make creating events on your device much easier. 

Purpose: We as college students see thousands of flyers for events on and off campus every semester. However, a students busy schedule doesnt always allow them to stay and check out a flyer for very long. So, EPRS our app is useful in that all you would need to do is take a picture of the flyer and the app would scan and anaylze all the words and try to predict what the date, description, Title and location of the event is. Then we provide a last minute check by the user manually with out predictions. Once the user is ready they click the creation button and it sends the event to the devices calendar on the exact time the event is. 

The app is still a prototype, it was created as our groups first capstone project. We used Swift langauge and various API as well as CocoaPods, all of these came together to provide the functionality and UI of the app. 

Thank you for checking it out!
